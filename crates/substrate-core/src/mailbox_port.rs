//! MailboxStore port — durable mailbox and tasklist backed by a concrete store.
//!
//! This port is implemented by `store-sqlite`; the core crate only defines the
//! contract. No IO, no adapter dependencies here.
//!
//! The port uses its own mirror types so that `substrate-core` stays free of
//! any dependency on `a2a` or adapter crates. `store-sqlite` maps between the
//! `a2a` types and these port-level types internally.

/// Opaque task state at the port boundary.
